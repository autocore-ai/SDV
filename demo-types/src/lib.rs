    // 1. What is it? We know from the (fake) Steam documentation that it's
    //    an IEngine*
    // 2. Do we gain ownership of it? i.e. is it our responsibility to
    //    destroy it?
    // 3. If not, C++ presumably continues to own it. Does C++ ever destroy
    //    it?
    // None of these things are really encoded in the nature of a void*
    // so you have to figure them out from the documentation.
    //
    // In this case, the first is easy:
    let steam_engine = steam_engine as *mut ffi::IEngine;
    //
    // You then need to figure out how to expose it in Rust. Ideally, any
    // such lifetime invariants would be handled by the compiler.
    // If C++ is passing ownership of this object to us, and we have the
    // prerogative to destroy it whenever we wish, then
    // simply use [`cxx::UniquePtr::from_raw`]. If it goes out of scope in
    // Rust the underlying C++ object will be deleted.
    //
    // Let's assume life is more complicated, and we must never destroy this
    // object (because it's owned by C++). In that case, we ideally want
    // to convert the pointer into a Rust reference with the lifetime of
    // the program.
    //
    // We also have to promise to Rust that it'll never move in memory.
    // C++ doesn't do that, so that's OK.
