## Overview

SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) project is a cooperative project between Autocore and Futurewei, which aims at providing the technology-consulting services by means of this 100 percent open source software stack with reference design for SDVs. Cloud-Edge service is also integrated as a part of this project to extend the V2X capabilities.

The SDV software stack is based on open source Autoware/ROS2/DDS and Zenoh, where DDS/Zenoh act as the E2E Vehicle-Edge-Cloud middleware layer for the SDV platform. Thru the integration with Futureweiâ€™ s open source KubeEdge project, the SDV platform will leverage Cloud Native Ecosystem tools to provide management, monitoring and software LCM (Life-Cycle-Management) functions.

The system architecture of SDV platform project is shown in the figure below:

## Quick Start Guide

### Hardware requirement

- Host:

  - Host PC:
    - CPU: x86_64 4 Core or above
    - RAM: 8G+
    - Disk: 30G+ free space
    - OS: Ubuntu 18.04+
    - cable Ethernet

- For each Worker (default sets 2 workers in cluster):

  - [AutoCore PCU][autocore pcu]

    - cable Ethernet

      **OR**

  - Worker PC (**Needs when you don't have [AutoCore PCU][autocore pcu]**):
    - CPU: x86_64 8 Core or above
    - RAM: 8G+
    - Disk: 30G+ free space
    - OS: Ubuntu 18.04+
    - cable Ethernet

### Environment setup

1. Host PC:

- ```bash
  $ source Utils/setup/k8s/control-plane/setup.bash
  ```
  Concole will output the information like `kubeadm join xxx`, please use this information for clients to join in later steps.

1. [AutoCore PCU][autocore pcu] **OR** Worker PC:

- ```bash
  $ source Utils/setup/k8s/worker/setup.bash
  ```
- ```bash
  $ sudo kubeadm join xxx
  ```
  Please find the `xxx` in the concole output of Host PC as described in step 1.

1. Back to Host PC

- For each worker node, label them:
  ```bash
  $ kubectl label node <worker_node_name> app=autoware
  ```

### Deploy workloads with config file

Default configs 2 workers in cluster, and if you have two works hardware, just run the default command:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autocore-ai/SDV/develop/sdv_demo.yaml
```

And if you have other custom deployment, Just download sdv_demo.yaml and fix the `replicas: 2` to your worker count N:

```diff
spec:
- replicas: 2
+ replicas: N
  selector:
```

then use this config file:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f sdv_demo.yaml
```

### Use [CloudViewer][cloudviewer] to display scene and send commands.

Open [CloudViewer][cloudviewer] with [Chromium][chromium] based browser

- Config IP Address to Host PC IP (defaults `127.0.0.1`)

- Move viewer with key `WSAD` and mouse midde and right key.

- Click on vehicle and traffic light to inspect and send commands.
